replicaCount: 1

# The max memory mprime will be configured to use, specified in megabytes.
# A higher value can improve calculation speed. This value is separate from any
# resource.limits.memory that is set, because it gets translated to a config field
# in prime.txt. This value MUST be less than any memory limits configured below or
# pods will receive OOM errors.
memoryMB: 8

# This configures how many unique workloads are being computed by a replica at any given time.
# Note that all CPU threads available will be used independent of this value, so setting this
# value higher won't necessarily yield faster results (e.g. 1 worker using 4 CPUs may be the
# same as 2 workers using 2 CPUs).
