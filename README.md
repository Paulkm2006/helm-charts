# A Helm Chart Repository

This repo hosts several helm charts for distributed computing projects made available via one helm repository.

- [`folding-at-home`](charts/folding-at-home): Donate compute for medical research through the Folding@home project and help cure diseases
- [`mprime`](charts/mprime): Donate compute to search for prime numbers via the [Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search](https://www.mersenne.org/) (GIMPS)!
- [`xmrig`](charts/xmrig): Mine [Monero](https://www.getmonero.org/) via leftover K8s cluster resources.

## Quickstart

To install the charts from this repo, you must first configure `helm` to use it.

```bash
# Add the repo to your local helm client's
helm repo add brannon https://helm.brannon.online

Once installed you can browse the available charts in the repo.
